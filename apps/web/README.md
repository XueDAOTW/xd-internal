**Authentication**

- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for user authentication.
- [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction) for wallet connection.
- [Magic Link](https://magic.link/) for email OTP login, possibly as a wallet provider in the future too for onboarding users without wallets.

**Styling**

- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for Tailwind components and themes.

**Storage**
